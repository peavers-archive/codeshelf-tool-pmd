# Codeshelf Tool ESLINT
Send the output from executing ESLINT to AWS Firehose

## Badges
The most important part of a readme of course

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1ec155d8109e4a0bbd87388f095679f8)](https://www.codacy.com/app/peavers/codeshelf-tool-eslint?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=peavers/codeshelf-tool-eslint&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Why
Just playing around with Firehose and seeing what cool server side processing I can do with it

## Running
You'll need to make sure the environment variables found in the application.yml fire are correctly set. 

The working directory should be the `src` directory of a javascript based project. 

## W.I.P
This may never get another commit, or it might get many...
