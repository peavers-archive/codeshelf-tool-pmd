# Codeshelf Tool PMD
Send the output from executing PMD to AWS Firehose

## Badges
The most important part of a readme of course

//TODO

## Why
Just playing around with Firehose and seeing what cool server side processing I can do with it

## Running
You'll need to make sure the environment variables found in the application.yml fire are correctly set. 

The working directory should be the `src` directory of a javascript based project. 

## W.I.P
This may never get another commit, or it might get many...
