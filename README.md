# Codeshelf Tool PMD
Send the output from executing PMD to AWS Firehose

## Badges
The most important part of a readme of course

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7c3b5e3317ce496c834c5e44fb2547f0)](https://www.codacy.com/app/peavers/codeshelf-tool-pmd?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=peavers/codeshelf-tool-pmd&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Why
Just playing around with Firehose and seeing what cool server side processing I can do with it

## Running
You'll need to make sure the environment variables found in the application.yml fire are correctly set. 

The working directory should be the `src` directory of a javascript based project. 

## W.I.P
This may never get another commit, or it might get many...
